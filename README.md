## Usage

1. Clone this repository to the device you will be running it from. (`git clone https://github.com/eliabntt/noip-renew.git`)
2. Run setup.sh and set your noip.com account information,
3. Run noip-renew-USERNAME command.

For information on how to set up Notifications, please read the Notifications section.

As a suggestion, run `setup.sh root` to save everything as root. In the current version of the code the password is store "encrypted" in a file which would be readable by anyone that has access to the pc if you do not do so. Alternatively, create a specific user for this purpose.

Check confirmed records from multiple log files:

``` bash
grep -h Confirmed *.log | grep -v ": 0" | sort
```

## Usage with Docker (not yet tested)

For docker users, run the following:
```sh
my_username='add username here'
my_password='add password here'
my_host_num='add number of hosts here'
debug_lvl=2
docker build -t loblab/selenium:debian .
echo -e "$(crontab -l)"$'\n'"12  3  *  *  1,3,5  docker run --network host loblab/selenium:debian ${my_username} ${my_password} ${my_host_num} ${debug_lvl}" | crontab -
```

To check script version, use command: ``noip-renew-username --version``

## Remarks

The script is not designed to renew/update the dynamic DNS records, though the latest version does have this ability if requested.
Check [noip.com documentation](https://www.noip.com/integrate) for that purpose.
Most wireless routers support noip.com. For more information, check [here](https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/what-devices-support-no-ips-dynamic-dns-update-service/).
You can also check [DNS-O-Matic](https://dnsomatic.com/) to update multiple noip.com DNS records.


## Notification Setup

### Pushover:

1. Create an account over at https://pushover.net/signup.

3. Create a [new application/API Token](https://pushover.net/apps/build). I've named mine "No-IP Host Monitor".

4. Once you've created your new App, you will see an API Token/Key. This is also required during setup.

5. Make sure you have the Pushover Application installed on your [device of choice](https://pushover.net/clients).
6. When running setup.sh, insert your pushover details when prompted.

### Slack:

1. Create an account over at https://slack.com/get-started#/create and set up your Team.
2. Once you're all set up, you will need to [create a new app](https://api.slack.com/apps)

3. The next step is to set up the correct permissions so that we can send a message with an image to Slack.

4. The required scopes are chat:write & files:write. These can be added by clicking "Add an OAuth Scope"

5. Once the scopes have been added, make sure you Reinstall App to reflect these changes.

7. Now you must make sure that you add the bot to your channel of choice. This channel will be used during setup.
