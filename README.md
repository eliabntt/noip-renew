This script auto clicks web pages to renew the hosts,

- Ver: 1.3

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to the device you will be running it from. (`git clone https://github.com/eliabntt/noip-renew.git`)
2. Run setup.sh and set your noip.com account information,
3. Run noip-renew-USERNAME command.

For information on how to set up Notifications, please read the Notifications section.

As a suggestion, run `setup.sh root` to save everything as root. In the current version of the code the password is store "encrypted" in a file which would be readable by anyone that has access to the pc if you do not do so. Alternatively, create a specific user for this purpose.

Check confirmed records from multiple log files:

``` bash
grep -h Confirmed *.log | grep -v ": 0" | sort
```

## Usage with Docker (not yet tested)

For docker users, run the following:
```sh
my_username='add username here'
my_password='add password here'
my_host_num='add number of hosts here'
debug_lvl=2
docker build -t loblab/selenium:debian .
echo -e "$(crontab -l)"$'\n'"12  3  *  *  1,3,5  docker run --network host loblab/selenium:debian ${my_username} ${my_password} ${my_host_num} ${debug_lvl}" | crontab -
```

To check script version, use command: ``noip-renew-username --version``


## Remarks

The script is not designed to renew/update the dynamic DNS records, though the latest version does have this ability if requested.
Check [noip.com documentation](https://www.noip.com/integrate) for that purpose.
Most wireless routers support noip.com. For more information, check [here](https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/what-devices-support-no-ips-dynamic-dns-update-service/).
You can also check [DNS-O-Matic](https://dnsomatic.com/) to update multiple noip.com DNS records.

<details><summary><strong>Pushover:</strong></summary>
<p>

1. Create an account over at https://pushover.net/signup.

3. Create a [new application/API Token](https://pushover.net/apps/build). I've named mine "No-IP Host Monitor".

![New Pushover App](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23632287/85068447-51041480-b1aa-11ea-8d30-6650488502ef.png)

4. Once you've created your new App, you will see an API Token/Key. This is also required during setup.

<details><summary><strong>Slack:</strong></summary>
<p>

1. Create an account over at https://slack.com/get-started#/create and set up your Team.

2. Once you're all set up, you will need to [create a new app](https://api.slack.com/apps)

![New Slack App](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23632287/85068598-9b859100-b1aa-11ea-9a87-4df4388f0309.png)

3. The next step is to set up the correct permissions so that we can send a message with an image to Slack.

![Slack Bot Permissions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23632287/85078604-ad702f80-b1bc-11ea-887b-24dc445fbc98.png)

4. The required scopes are chat:write & files:write. These can be added by clicking "Add an OAuth Scope"

![Add Scope](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23632287/85078653-ca0c6780-b1bc-11ea-825f-ee9e28c2fb70.png)

5. Once the scopes have been added, make sure you Reinstall App to reflect these changes.

![Reinstall App](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23632287/85078735-fe802380-b1bc-11ea-8a01-4d6f59e9df0a.png)

6. Make a note of your Bot User OAuth Access Token as this is used during setup.

7. Now you must make sure that you add the bot to your channel of choice. This channel will be used during setup.

<details><summary><strong>Telegram:</strong></summary>
<p>

1. Create a Telegram account by downloading the App to your device https://telegram.org/.
   - <sub>Please note, for Telegram you need to use your mobile number.</sub>

2. After you have an account set up, I recommend setting the bot up using a [browser](https://web.telegram.org/) on a device you can copy and paste from.

3. Navigate to https://telegram.me/BotFather and set up a new bot. I did this using `/start` followed by `/newbot`.

![Telegram BotFather](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23632287/85134354-3fffe580-b234-11ea-98f9-e64306c9c264.png)

4. Follow the steps through, naming your bot. Finding a free username was tricky.

5. You will now be given an access token. This will be needed for setup so make a note of this.

![Telegram Access Token](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23632287/85134895-1abfa700-b235-11ea-8fab-66ef43a1bb86.png)

6. Click the link to your bot in order to open a chat window with it. Keep this window open for now.

7. Run setup.sh and select Telegram. When prompted to enter an access token, enter the token you received earlier.

8. You should now be given a 5 digit code which you must send via Telegram to your bot. Setup of Telegram is now complete.
